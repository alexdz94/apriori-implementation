# Apriori-Algorithm-implementation

This repository presents a Java Implementation for the famous algorithm Apriori that extracts the frequent itemsets in a transactional database.

The implementation has three classes :
  - **launch** for browsing and choising the dataset file (csv file) and giving the minimum support.
  - **FrequentItemsets** for a k-itemset object (list of items + k)
  - **Apriori** is the main algorithm of apriori
